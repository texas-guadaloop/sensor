Combined Circuit:

Issues with board:

Ground:
A ground plane seems to be the right decision, but there needs to be a connection from the plane to battery and microcontroller ground

Power:
All circuits can take power from the same source, so should there be a power line that runs through the board? If so, how? I have no idea . . .

Outputs:
We need to get the outputs connected with the TM4C, lets look at the pinout and put that on the board,

Actual Connections:
Are we mounting the battery on the board? (Most likely not, right?)
Are we mounting the board onto the microcontroller? Or are we using a ribbon cable?
- The ribbon cable may end up being the way to go. I don't like the idea of running large currents near the microcontroller
